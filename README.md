# PROJECT // NOTEBLOCK

Music creation software with sounds from Minecraft.

Uses only Python, numpy, tkinter, and libraries for loading/playing sounds.

Tested with Python 3.12. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries, then `python src/main.py` to run the program.

A video demonstration can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcFQi5cvCZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcFQi5cvCZo). Jump to 4:26 for a showcase of the demo song and live looping.

The demo song and exported audio from the video can be found in `songs/`. `sounds/` contains samples of Minecraft note blocks, from which all audio is generated.

This project was completed as coursework for A Level Computer Science. The accompanying documentation and writeup can be found in `docs/`.
